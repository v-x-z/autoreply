this is a discord autoreply, that automatically replies to mentions including ones in dms and servers

this only works with python and discord.py 1.7.3 and a code editor (vs code could be preferred if you arent familiar with coding)

make a .py file in your code editor

make a new enviroment and go to your terminal and paste in the installation:

pip install discord.py==1.7.3

then paste the code from the autoreply.py into your python file and run it

then congratulations you now have a discord autoreply to reply to all of your dms while your away or afk
